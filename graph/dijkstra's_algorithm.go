// DijkstraShortestPath find the shortest path and lowest cost
// from one node to all other node given a source node with an amazing
// time complexity of O((V+E)log(V)) but only works if weights are non-negative.
// https://youtu.be/EFg3u_E6eHU
//
// Algorithm:
// 	- 1. Label each node with the shortest path found so far,
//		 In beginning wih 0 for source and other with 'âˆž'.
//  - 2. Mark src as 'EXPLORED' and other as 'UNEXPLORED'
//  - 3. Loop until reached destination node:
//       - Update estimates if found smaller value than current estimate.
//       - Keep track of what previous node visited to get to this node.
//         Which nodes led to this shortest path.
//       - Choose next 'UNEXPLORED' vertex with the smallest estimate

				dist[node.vertex] = dist[currentlyVisited] + node.weight
				followedBy[node.vertex] = currentlyVisited
			}

			// Choose next 'UNEXPLORED' vertex with the smallest estimate
			// First of OR condition checks when you visit nextToVisit
			// currentlyVisited becomes nextToVisit; that mean nextToVisit is not known now
