# FAQ  🤔
1. **Why in Go? Why not in Python/C/C++ etc?**

As for C/C++, you can, you probably should! But when the focus is learning DSA, C/C++'s complexity can become a barrier. As for Python, it's already done by [thisisshub](https://github.com/thisisshub/).

Then why Go? One reason is for pure performance comparable to C, combined with the simplicity and ease like python.😎

2. **How do I use it?**

Go through them one by one, and reimplement in your favourite language.

# Prerequisites 📝
Install Go for your relevant platform. If you are using editors or IDEs it's fairly easy to play through them, otherwise you can run these commands:

- Running all tests 

   ```go
   go test ./...
   ```
- Running all benchmark
  
  ```go
  go test ./... -bench ./...
  ```
- Benchmarking a package, go into that package and,

  ```go
  go test -bench .
  ```
- Testing a package, go into that package and

  ```go
  go test .
  ```
